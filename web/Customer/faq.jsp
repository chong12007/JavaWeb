        <div class="accordion-header">1. Can I recycle the packaging?<hr></div>
        
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>We are striving hard to make our entire packaging recyclable. At this point, 50% of our packaging is recyclable. You can feel safe to recycle the outer boxes, however the primary packaging are at the moment non-recyclable for the protection of the quality and safety of our formula. That being said, it is a part of Evolcare’s vision to bring positive impact to the planet. We are working very hard to bring recyclable and sustainable packaging to you, where our team is currently conducting various research and prototype testing, so we’ll be the first to let you know when this becomes an available option by 2022!</p>

        <div class="accordion-header">2. Are your products all-natural? What does 100% natural active mean?<hr></div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>It is our goal to empower people to achieve a youthful, healthy skin with highly efficient yet natural skincare regimens. While Evolcare aims to produce natural products, it is also our mission to bring you effective products. Evolcare products contain 100% natural actives, which means that the active ingredients are harvested from nature. Active ingredients are the ones added to the formula to make the product effective and to help with targeted skin concerns. Our leave-on products are at least 95% natural, but what’s more important is that our products are safe to use, without harmful chemicals.</p>

        <div class="accordion-header">3. Are there chemical or synthetics used in you products?<hr></div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>It is our promise to keep your health and wellbeing on top of our priorities list! We have succeeded in keeping our formulation at least 95% natural for all our leave-on skincare products. In order to achieve highly effective results (e.g. stability, efficacy), we have only used minimal safe synthetic products. We do not add unnecessary preservatives nor surfactants, in order to avoid burdening your skin, yet achieving high efficacy for healthy & glowing skin. We promise that our skincare products do not and will never contain the following substances:

            i. Petrolatum/ Mineral Oil/ Paraffin ii. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) iii. Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) iv. Phthalate v. Paraben vi. Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI) vii. Alcohol (Ethanol, Methanol) viii. Lanolin ix. Chemical Sunscreen x. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-Releasing Agents</p>

        <div class="accordion-header">4. Where are your products produced? <hr></div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>We formulate and source ingredients from all around the world to bring you the authentic regional ingredients. Your Evolcare products have travelled to your home from Switzerland, France, Japan and Korea! Rest assured that while the products don’t carry passports like the globetrotters in our Evolcare family, our products are however all manufactured in cGMP compliance factories– ensuring high quality and safety standards.</p>

        <div class="accordion-header">5. Do you test products on animals? <hr></div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>No! We love our furry friends just as much as you! Evolcare is all about love & care and we do no animal testing. On the other hand, we’ve used the products ourselves and we hope you love them just as much as we do!</p>

        <div class="accordion-header">5. Are your products safe to use for sensitive skin, children, and pregnant women? <hr></div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Even though Evolcare products are formulated without any harmful chemicals, we’d advise children, pregnant women, consumers with sensitive skin or health conditions to consult a physician prior to using our products. In particular, the “Sparkles” Skin Reviving Mask, “Clarity” Mineral Clay Mask, “Skin Revive” Scrub and “Vibe” Soothing Chamomile Eye Gel contain Salicylic Acid and Glycolic acid, which is effective to help unclogging pores and clear our skin, but it is not recommended for customers with extreme, sensitive skin and health conditions. As customers in these categories are generally more prone to irritations or allergic reactions, please take the precaution to consult a physician first, then proceed to patch test products on the back of your hand.</p>
